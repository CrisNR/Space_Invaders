                        <h2 id>The story of Space Invaders: Futurama</h2>
                        <p>One day, 
                        As President Richard Nixon is preparing to sign a treaty 
                        with Ambassador Donkey Kong of Nintenduu 64. 
                        Ambassador Kong attacks Nixon and a state of war erupts, 
                        with the ambassador for Italy (Mario) 
                        expressing his distress. Despite having their best flagship, the Nimbus,
                        commanded by the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan, and his 
                        Lieutenant Kif Kroker, they were unable to prevent the invasion
                        of earth. All hope was lost until one person emerged, claiming
                        to have extensive knowledge of video games, stating he is able to defeat
                        them! Packing with snacks, soda, and his all-Rush cassette tape, he
                        prepares for the ultimate battle and tries to defeat the invaders, possibly
                        from space. Will he prevail or suffer the consequences?</p>
                        <h3>Protagonist</h3>
                        <div><img src="assets/fry.jpeg" alt="Fry"></div>
                        <h4>Philip J. Fry</h4>
                        <p>Fry was a native to the 20th century who was 
                        cryogenically frozen seconds into the year 2000, having fallen in 
                        just as 1999 ended. He was revived in 2999 and subsequently became 
                        a Delivery boy for the Planet Express Company. Now with his knowledge
                        of video games from the past, he is ready to kick some 64-bit butts.</p>

                        <h3>Antagonist</h3>
                        <div><img src="assets/invaders.jpeg" alt="Space Invaders"></div>
                        <h4>The Invaders</h4>
                        <p>The Invaders are a fleet of spacecraft led by Lrrr of Nintenduu 64. 
                        The fleet invades the Planet Earth, 
                        in an attempt to get all of Earth's quarters to do their laundry.
                        The Nintendians are a species of non-canon Aliens 
                        that resemble video game characters, except for Lrrr, who hails from
                        Omicron Persei 8. Nothing is known on how Lrrr became the leader of 
                        this group, but one thing for sure is that you need to take him
                        seriously.</p>

                        <h3>Location</h3>
                        <h4>New New York</h4>
                        <div><img src="assets/newNewYork.jpg" alt="New New York"></div>
                        <p>New New York is a major city on the Planet Earth located in 
                        the State of New New York, which is built directly on top of 
                        the ruins of Old New York, which is still accessible via the 
                        New New York Sewer System. Our protagonist, Fry, resides in this 
                        city.</p>
