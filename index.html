            <p>&emsp;Hello there, fellow Earthican and welcome to New New York!
            The year is 3000 and so much has changed since your time, but fear not!
            You will settle in just right. Once we implant your career chip into your
            palm, you are able to go out and explore the new territory. Hopefully
            you don't become a delivery person as a career, but beggars can't be
            choosers! While we are processing Lars Fillmore, please continue
            with Turanga Leela for the next step. </p>

            <p>&emsp;Hello and thank you for taking your time to visit our website.
                This website was created for our CSUN web engineering class as the 
                final project. The assigment was to create a website of our choice,
                and our group decided to make a website that hosts a 2D pixel shooter
                game. After thorough thinking, we came up with a space invaders type
                but with a splash of Futurama theme, since there is a episode based on
                that, here is the
                <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthology_of_Interest_II" title = "Anthology of Interest II Wiki">link</a>
                to the wikipedia page.</p>
            <p>&emsp;Please check the rest of the website, using our navigation menu
                 to the left side of the screen and see what it has to offer.
                Again thank you for your time and  hope you enjoy it.
                You can also click on the link below to view our code for the game and the 
                html file.</p>
